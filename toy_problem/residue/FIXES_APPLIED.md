# Critical Fixes Applied for Bad Inference Predictions

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### ðŸ”§ Fix #1: Improved Generation Method
**File**: `transformer_model.py`

**Problem**: 
- Started generation with arbitrary token 0
- Used `temperature=0.0` which caused numerical issues
- Always used stochastic sampling, even for deterministic evaluation

**Solution**:
```python
def generate(..., greedy=False, start_tokens=None):
    if greedy or temperature == 0.0:
        next_token = torch.argmax(next_token_logits, dim=-1, keepdim=True)
    else:
        # Sample from distribution
        ...
```

**Benefits**:
- Greedy decoding for deterministic evaluation
- Proper handling of temperature=0
- Optional start tokens for better initialization

### ðŸ”§ Fix #2: Fixed Evaluation in Training
**File**: `training.py` 

**Problem**:
- Used `temperature=0.0` which broke softmax
- No greedy decoding option

**Solution**:
```python
predicted_tokens = self.model.generate(
    conditioning, 
    max_length=target_tokens.shape[1],
    greedy=True,  # Use argmax instead of temperature=0
    device=self.device
)
```

## Quick Troubleshooting Checklist

### 1. Check if Model is Learning
```python
# Look at training logs
# Loss should decrease over epochs
# Token accuracy should increase

# If loss is stuck high:
# - Learning rate might be too low
# - Model capacity might be too small
# - Data might have issues
```

### 2. Check Tokenizer Quality
```python
from debug_predictions import check_tokenizer_quality

# Reconstruction error should be low
# If high, tokenizer is too lossy
```

### 3. Debug Single Prediction
```python
from debug_predictions import debug_single_prediction

debug_single_prediction(model, tokenizer, conditioning, targets)
# This will create visualization and show metrics
```

### 4. Verify Model Shape Consistency
All shape fixes have been applied:
- âœ… PositionalEncoding uses batch_first=True
- âœ… No unnecessary transposes
- âœ… Shape assertions added throughout

## Additional Improvements to Try

### Increase Model Capacity
```python
model = SimpleTransformer(
    vocab_size=256,
    d_model=256,      # Increased from 128
    nhead=8,
    num_layers=6,     # Increased from 4
    max_seq_len=1000
)
```

### Train Longer
```python
trainer.train(
    train_loader, 
    val_loader, 
    num_epochs=200,   # Increased from 100
    patience=50       # More patience
)
```

### Adjust Learning Rate
```python
trainer = Trainer(
    model, 
    tokenizer, 
    device,
    learning_rate=5e-4,    # Try different rates: 1e-3, 5e-4, 1e-4
    weight_decay=1e-4
)
```

### Use Learning Rate Scheduler
Add to training.py:
```python
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import ReduceLROnPlateau

scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optimizer, mode='min', factor=0.5, patience=10)
# Call after each epoch:
scheduler.step(val_loss)
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| MSE is very high (>1.0) | Model not trained enough or wrong architecture |
| Token accuracy < 10% | Model not learning - check loss function |
| Predictions are constant | Model collapsed - reinitialize and retrain |
| NaN in loss | Gradient explosion - add gradient clipping (already done) |
| Loss plateaus early | Learning rate too low or model too small |

## Testing Your Fixes

1. **Retrain the model** from scratch with the fixes
2. **Monitor training** - loss should steadily decrease
3. **Check token accuracy** - should reach >50% for H=25
4. **Visualize predictions** using debug_predictions.py
5. **Compare** binning vs FAST tokenizer

## Expected Performance

For H=25 (lowest frequency), you should expect:
- **Training loss**: < 1.0 after convergence
- **Token accuracy**: > 50%
- **MSE**: < 0.1 for good performance
- **Visual match**: Predictions should follow general spline shape

If still getting bad results, the issue might be:
- Insufficient training data
- Model architecture mismatch
- Tokenizer resolution too coarse
- Need for different conditioning strategy
